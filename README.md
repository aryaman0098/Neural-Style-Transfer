# Neural-Style-Transfer
This Neural Style Transfer project that takes two images as input. It takes content of the first image (i.e. the objects) and style of the second image (i.e. the art work) and return the finished image (which is the combination of both). The code uses PyTorch library. The content image and style image are taken form input folder and output image is saved in output folder
